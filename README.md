  Lab 5 - Design Decisions & Challenges

 Design Decisions
1. Color System 
   I used the provided CSS variables for consistency and added a dark theme override to allow theme switching.

2. Typography  
   A clean sans-serif font (Arial) was chosen for readability and modern design.

3. Cards 
   Rounded corners with shadows for a modern soft look  and Hover lift effect for interactivity.

4. Buttons 
   Distinct color variants (primary, success, warning, info) and outline styles for flexibility

5. Chips  
   Compact pill-shaped design with icons and a close button. Active state highlighted with primary color.

6. Navigation Bar 
   Horizontal layout with active link indicator (underline). Logo aligned left, theme toggle on right.

7. Forms  
   Consistent spacing, styled focus states with glow, and rounded corners for inputs.

8. Responsive Design 
   Used grid` and flexbox with media queries and Navbar collapses into stacked layout on small screens.

9. Theme Toggle
   Implemented light/dark mode switching with a single button using CSS variable overrides.

 Challenges
 Implementing responsive grids for cards without making them look cluttered.
 Ensuring hover and focus states worked consistently across light and dark modes.

 Conclusion
The final design achieves:
- Modern visual design
- Full responsiveness
- Interactive states
- Theme switching
- Clean, well-organized CSS
