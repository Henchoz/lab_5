What I Did in the Code
Design Choices I Made
1. Color System

Used CSS variables for easy theme changes

Made primary, secondary, success, warning colors

Added dark mode for night viewing

Created blue and green theme options

2. Component Styling

Made cards with shadow and hover effects

Buttons have different states (hover, active, disabled)

Chips can be clicked to activate/deactivate

Forms have nice input fields with focus states

3. Layout & Spacing

Used CSS Grid for card layouts

Flexbox for button groups

Consistent spacing with CSS variables

Mobile-first design (works on phone and computer)

4. Interactive Features

Added ripple effect when buttons clicked

Cards lift up when you hover over them

Smooth color transitions everywhere

Toast messages for user feedback

Challenges I Faced
1. Theme Switching Problem

Challenge: When changing themes, some colors didn't update properly

Solution: Used CSS variables and JavaScript to update all colors at once

2. Mobile Responsiveness

Challenge: Components looked messy on small screens

Solution: Used media queries and flexible layouts that adjust automatically

3. Button Effects

Challenge: Making the ripple effect work smoothly

Solution: Created CSS animations and positioned ripples where user clicks

4. Customization Panel

Challenge: Real-time updates without page refresh

Solution: Used JavaScript to change CSS variables instantly

5. Consistent Styling

Challenge: Making all components look like they belong together

Solution: Used same colors, spacing, and shadows across all elements
